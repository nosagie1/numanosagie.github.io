                                        <p>This is a second course in computer programming. The purpose of the course is to learn how to use and implement
                                        canonical data structures such as lists, iterators, stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, binary search trees,
                                        balanced binary search trees, sets, maps, hash tables, heaps, tries, and graphs. The course also covers testing,
                                        reasoning about programs (pre/post conditions, assertions), debugging, abstraction of data, basic algorithm analysis,
                                        recursion, canonical sorting and searching algorithms, an introduction to the object oriented concepts of encapsulation,
                                        inheritance, and polymorphism, dynamic programming, and functional programming in Java.</p>

The Sweatt Center includes a research focus that informs public policy experts, practitioners, and concerned citizens on how best to create and maintain a culture of Black male excellence in K-16 settings. This research guides a hands-on practical approach to help the Sweatt Center achieve its major goals: to increase the four-year graduation rate for African American males at The University of Texas at Austin and to increase the number of Black males attending four-year colleges and universities across the state of Texas.</p>
