My two sisters and I were born and raised in Houston, Texas, but amongst a community of Nigerians and other minorities. In our early years, we were never disconnected from our inherited culture. From my father singing nursery rhymes to us in Yoruba to my grandmother preparing various cultural dishes for us as she awaits our return from school, my household members are never far from their roots. Growing up in a Nigerian household, my parents were never easy on me. They&#39;ve expected the best out of me in every aspect of my life, from simple household tasks to academics. This toughness that I experienced daily caused me to set high standards for myself and my colleagues that I continuously aim to meet. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Catholic, I&#39;m dedicated to worshiping God and serving others. Reading the Bible daily, I&#39;ve learned many lessons on kindness, stewardship, and how Christians should strive to be like Jesus. Although I must admit that I have not reached Jesus&#39; perfect, sinless state of being, I believe that I&#39;m taking a step closer every day. Additionally, as an altar server, I performed various tasks, including guiding the priest to the pulpit and delivering the Holy Bible. Years pass, and I assumed a role more befitting of an older teen like myself as an usher. Throughout my years of volunteering at my Catholic church, I&#39;ve experienced growth and maturity that I hope will carry into all aspects of my life. Though my work may not have had the most tangible impact on the greater Houston community, it manifests its significance through my more profound connection with God.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a former athlete, my determination to succeed carries over into everything I do. Soccer is not just about running and scoring goals. Excelling in the sport requires patience, confidence, and discipline. Additionally, as team captain, I was entrusted with the leadership and encouragement of my teammates. When my coaches appointed me as a captain, they selected me because of my unending desire for self and teamwide improvement. Every successful organization needs a leader, so I always make my best effort to be someone my teammates can look to for confidence and guidance. In my final year of high school, I made it my goal to be an exceptional captain for my final season. I aspire to use these joyful leadership experiences to be an effective software owner in the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The characteristics of these three facets of myself have always caused me to create goals for myself that others may view as naive or inconceivable. Although like many others, one of my goals is to become wealthy, my desire to serve people with the money I earn stems from my love for my mother country (Nigeria) and my faith in God. I can imagine that my characteristics and background will appreciably contribute to the diverse student body at the University of Texas at Austin.</span></p></body></html>
