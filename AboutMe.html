							<h1>About Me</h1>
                            <h2>I am a Nigerian-American, Catholic, and student-athlete.</h2>
							<p style="text-indent: 40px">
                                My parents had three children, with me being the oldest. My two sisters and I
were born and raised in Houston, Texas, but amongst a community of Nigerians and
other minorities. In our early years, we were never disconnected from our inherited
culture. From my father singing nursery rhymes to us in Yoruba to my grandmother
preparing various cultural dishes for us as she awaits our return from school, my
household members are never far from their roots. Growing up in a Nigerian
household, my parents were never easy on me. They've expected the best out of me
in every aspect of my life, from simple household tasks to academics. This toughness
that I experienced daily caused me to set high standards for myself and my
colleagues that I continuously aim to meet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">
As a Catholic, I'm dedicated to worshiping God and serving others. Reading
the Bible daily, I've learned many lessons on kindness, stewardship, and how
Christians should strive to be like Jesus. Although I must admit that I have not
reached Jesus' perfect, sinless state of being, I believe that I'm taking a step closer
every day. Additionally, as an altar server, I performed various tasks, including
guiding the priest to the pulpit and delivering the Holy Bible. Years pass, and I
assumed a role more befitting of an older teen like myself as an usher. Throughout
my years of volunteering at my Catholic church, I've experienced growth and
maturity that I hope will carry into all aspects of my life. Though my work may not
have had the most tangible impact on the greater Houston community, it manifests
its significance through my more profound connection with God.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">
As a former athlete, my determination to succeed carries over into everything
I do. Soccer is not just about running and scoring goals. Excelling in the sport
requires patience, confidence, and discipline. Additionally, as team captain, I was
entrusted with the leadership and encouragement of my teammates. When my
coaches appointed me as a captain, they selected me because of my unending desire
for self and teamwide improvement. Every successful organization needs a leader, so
I always make my best effort to be someone my teammates can look to for
confidence and guidance. In my final year of high school, I made it my goal to be an
exceptional captain for my final season. I aspire to use these joyful leadership
experiences to be an effective software owner in the future.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">
The characteristics of these three facets of myself have always caused me to
create goals for myself that others may view as naive or inconceivable. Although like
many others, one of my goals is to become wealthy, my desire to serve people with
the money I earn stems from my love for my mother country (Nigeria) and my faith
in God. I can imagine that my characteristics and background will appreciably
contribute to the diverse student body at the University of Texas at Austin
